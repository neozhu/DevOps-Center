  # The workflow will run whenever an event happens on a pull request
  pull_request:
    # The events are that a PR is opened, or when a commit is pushed
    # to a branch that has an existing pull request
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, push]
    # The branches filter allows to specify that this workflow should only
    # run if the branch name is "UAT". This way we prevent this workflow
    # from running when PRs are opened on other branches
    branches:
      - UAT
    # We only care about changes to the force-app directory, which is the
    # root directory of the sfdx project. This prevents the job from running
    # when changing non-salesforce files (like this yml file).
